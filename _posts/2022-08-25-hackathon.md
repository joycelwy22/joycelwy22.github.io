Over the last weekend, I attended a hackathon organized by Great Learning (also the one conducting the MIT Professional Education Applied Data Science Course). 

The main goal was to determine the relative importance of different parameters in affecting Shinkansen passengers' overall travel experience. Dataset with categorical and numerical parameters like seat comfort and delay in minutes was given. I first explored the dataset using exploratory data analysis methods, then handled missing data by filling in mean (numerical) and mode (categorical) values. The dataset was then standardized and was ready to go. I had three attempts using neural network, catboost and xgboost. The neural network had an accuracy of 83.1%, catboost had an accuracy of 95.6% and xgboost 95.2%.

In the end, I ranked 3rd out of 32 groups. It was a fun experience to try out different algorithms and think of ways to improve the model performance. There are still many techniques that can possibly increase the accuracy and I look forward to building more accurate and useful models in the future! :D
