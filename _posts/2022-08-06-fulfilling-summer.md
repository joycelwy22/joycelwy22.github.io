title: "Fulfilling summer"

This summer has been very fulfilling. The first "achievement" would be wrapping up my master's thesis and passing the defense. 
I attended several workshops and summer school, where I learned about running NWP models in the cloud (AWS and Google Cloud), 
explainability of artificial intelligence, the use of satellite remote sensing for measuring urban heat island, and 
constructing heat vulnerability indices. 

In addition, I revisited a range of machine learning topics and worked on 3 projects on data analysis and 
deep learning in the 12-week MIT Professional Education Applied Data Science course. I am excited to use the algorithms and 
techniques in my future projects and career!

In this coming month, I am going to gear up for my job by getting more familiar with ArcGIS and maybe working on some 
competitions on Kaggle!
